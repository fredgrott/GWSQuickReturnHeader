GWSQuickReturnHeader
---

The quick return header UI pattern, borrowed from Manuel Peinado as it will be modified to
be able to inclde a footer nd see about beter edge efects below api 14 as currently
the EdgeEffectsCompat stuff only works on those platforms before api 14 that suport edge effects otherwise it
just effecs a no-op.
